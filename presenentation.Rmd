library(extrafont)

```

## Why did I decide to make this application?

<style>
div.square { background-color : #FADBD8; border-radius: 15px; padding: 15px 10px 10px 10px;}
</style>
<div class = "square">

There is a good saying "Eat your own dog food" (I really hope that people are still saying it, otherwise I am just being weird...).

So why not use ggplot graphs to represent your skills in your Curriculum Vitae?
 

</div>

## What inputs are available?

In my app you can input:

* Skill names;
* Skill grades;
* The color of the bubbles.

More inputs will be available later!

## Example

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

skills_names <- c("R", "Tableau", "Python", "Excel", "Machine \nLearning")
    skills_values <- c(6, 4, 2, 9, 3)
    
    skills <- data.frame(skill = skills_names,
                  grade = skills_values)

ggplot(skills, aes(x = skill, y = grade)) +
        geom_segment(aes(x = skill, xend = skill, y = 0, yend = grade), color="#A0A0A0") +
        geom_point(size = 10, color = "#943126") +
        labs(title = "Skills", y = "Proficiency") +
        theme_minimal() +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 25), 
              text = element_text(family = "Montserrat"), 
              axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
              axis.title.x = element_blank(),
              axis.title.y = element_text(size = 18),
              axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15),
              axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 18)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,10, by = 1), minor_breaks = seq(0,10, by = 1)) +
        coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 10))
```

## Ways to improve it

This app is just a playground for the project I have in mind, so there are still a lot of things I want to do:

* Add possibility to download the graph;
* Add "Font"" as an input field;
* Make possipibility to input as many skills as you want (not exactly 5);
* And finally - make all my CV in Shiny Dashboard. That would be awesome, right?

## Thank you!

Please add any suggestion to the comments, I really appreciate it :)
